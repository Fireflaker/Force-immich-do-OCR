# Session Persistence Fix

## 🔍 **Problem Identified:**
The application wasn't retaining login information between runs.

## 🛠️ **Root Cause:**
Our version was trying to set the profile on an existing page with `page.setProfile(profile)`, but this doesn't work reliably.

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**
Copied the EXACT working method from the proven working version:

### **Before (Broken):**
```python
# Apply this profile to the page
page = self.page()
if hasattr(page, 'setProfile'):
    page.setProfile(profile)
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```python  
# CRITICAL FIX: Create NEW page with profile (from working version)
page = QWebEnginePage(profile, self)
self.setPage(page)
```

## 🔧 **Additional Improvements:**
1. **Profile directory creation**: Ensure the directory exists with `Path().mkdir()`
2. **Debug output**: Show profile path and cookie settings
3. **Proper imports**: Added `QWebEnginePage` import

## 📁 **Profile Location:**
The session data is stored in:
```
{HOME}/.immich_ocr_profile_immich_ocr_persistent/
```

## ✅ **Expected Behavior:**
- Login information should persist between app runs
- Cookies and session storage retained
- No need to re-login every time

## 🧪 **Testing:**
1. Run `python main_app.py`
2. Look for debug output showing profile directory creation
3. Login to Immich
4. Close and restart the app
5. Should remain logged in

**🎯 This matches the working version's session persistence implementation exactly.**
