Core workflow:
Select area to ocr, do ocr with filter, write ocr results to description field after focusing on it (required for it to save), write out(save), go to next photo.


Key requirements:

Retain login at new lunch - no need to log in with username and password every time
Add a refresh button
Make two seperate user adjustable delay for image to load, and for description to save after write out.
